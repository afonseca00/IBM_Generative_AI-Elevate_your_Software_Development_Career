# Final Project: Personalized Learning Platform for Software Developers

## Description
In this project, I developed a personalized learning platform for software developers using the ChatGPT API. The system allows users to receive course, resource, and exercise recommendations based on their preferences and learning goals. The platform was built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and user authentication. Additionally, I implemented unit tests using Jest to ensure code quality and Docker to containerize the application.

By working on this project, I gained hands-on experience in building full-stack applications using generative AI to optimize learning and development.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I learned how to:
1. Build a personalized learning platform using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
2. Integrate the ChatGPT API to provide personalized learning recommendations.
3. Implement user authentication with JWT.
4. Write unit tests using Jest to ensure code functionality and quality.
5. Dockerize the application for easier deployment and scalability.

Generative AI is a fascinating and evolving field, and I explored how to use it effectively in this project to create a more efficient learning experience.

## Prerequisites
To complete this project, I used my knowledge of **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **JWT**, and **Docker**:
- **Node.js**: Allowed me to run JavaScript on the server-side, making it easy to build RESTful APIs.
- **Express.js**: Simplified route management, HTTP request handling, and serving static resources.
- **MongoDB**: Used for storing user data and learning preferences.
- **JWT**: Implemented for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Docker**: Containerized the application for easier deployment and environment management.

### Why I Chose These Technologies:
- **Node.js and Express.js**: They are fast, scalable, and ideal for building modern web applications.
- **MongoDB**: Provides flexibility for storing unstructured data, such as learning preferences.
- **JWT**: Enables secure and efficient user authentication.
- **Docker**: Simplifies the creation of isolated environments and running the application on different machines.
