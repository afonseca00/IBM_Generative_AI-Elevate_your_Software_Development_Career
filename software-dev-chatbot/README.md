# Lab1: Building a Basic Chatbot using ChatGPT

## Description
In this project, I built a basic chatbot capable of answering questions related to software development. Using Node.js, the Express.js framework, and OpenAI's API, I created an interactive chatbot with a simple user interface made with HTML and CSS.  

By working on this, I got hands-on experience with integrating OpenAI's API and building a responsive application.

## Prerequisites
To complete this project, I used my knowledge of **Node.js** and **Express.js**, which are essential tools for modern web development:  
- **Node.js**: Allowed me to run JavaScript on the server side.  
- **Express.js**: Made it easier to manage routes, handle API requests, and serve static files.

### Why I Chose Node.js and Express.js:
- **Fast and Scalable**: Perfect for handling multiple simultaneous requests efficiently.  
- **Flexible**: I could easily extend functionality using additional libraries or middleware.  
- **User-Friendly**: Since I already knew JavaScript, it felt natural to work with these tools.
